Not sure how to really separate this out but I'll just get writing things and see where we get. I feel like people usually split out into speech, comprehension, etc. so I guess I'll start with that.

## Reading and Speaking

Basically done none so nothing to report there.

Do have the occasional conversation in my head but that's about that. I think I could probably stumble my way though some basic interactions (ordering drinks/food, asking where things are, etc.), although I'm sure that'd be different in real life.

## Listening

This is where I feel very happy with my progress. I started understanding nothing but "Hola" and "Una cerveza por favor" and have finished by being able to understand all the super beginner videos and have begun on the beginner videos.

I did about 40 hours in early 2024 and after stopping for about 8 months for no reason other than being a bit lazy I picked it back up in early 2025 and I surprised myself with how much I've held onto. 

I've been mostly watching Dreaming Spanish (DS) videos but I have started back on [¡Cuéntame! podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/5rNQFzsH92cZpwLDSbUmmc) at around 50 hours which I have really enjoyed and am hoping I can keep up with the level, but if not I will push with the DS videos until I can. 

I still translate newer words in my head, but I have noticed the basic stuff which is in most sentences are pretty much automatic and I don't even think about it, which is very encouraging.

### Random Thoughts

Watching translated Spanish travel content where people speak good Spanish is very motivating, and is one of my goals/motivations for learning Spanish.

Podcasts are by far the easiest way to keep the daily numbers up as I can do it out on a walk or when I'm doing jobs. They're not as approachable now at 50 hours, but I'm hoping that they will become more accessible over the next 100 hours.

### The Future

The plan for the future is to try and get to the intermediate videos and podcasts as soon as possible so I can really up my hours. I have plenty of time on my hands to listen now so I'm just going to try and keep consistent.

I want to visit to South America in around 2 and a half years so I want to get to 1500 hours by then. To hit this goal I need to listen to 1 and a half hours average over that time. I am currently on 40 minutes average for this month and think I can increase this when I hit the higher levels. 

### Conclusion 

Overall I'm really happy with my progress so far and I am enjoying the journey. I think it will be a long long road with lots of challenges but I am looking forward to tackling it.

An issue I've had switching to [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) is that typing <kbd>#</kbd> (on a mac) causes me to switch to workspace 3:


```toml title=".aerospace.toml"
[mode.main.binding]
    alt-3 = 'workspace 3'
```

A fix [I came across](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/28#issuecomment-2128438480) was to define an *empty* [binding mode](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#binding-modes). When switching to a new binding mode, all the previous bindings are disabled in favour of the new bindings, allowing me to type <kbd>#</kbd>.

To get this working I mapped <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Backspace</kbd> in the main and new mode to toggle between them:

```toml title=".aerospace.toml"
[mode.main.binding]
    alt-backspace = 'mode hash'

[mode.hash.binding]
    alt-backspace = 'mode main'
```

I think this is currently the best solution but it would be nice to map the left and right modifier keys separately.

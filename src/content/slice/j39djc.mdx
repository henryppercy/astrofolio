I love Mexican food and living in London I am spoilt for Mexican restaurants. [Michelin](https://guide.michelin.com/en/greater-london/london/restaurant/kol) Mexican restaurants, Mexican street vendors, and everything in between.

I have been to 5 of the 'in-between' places and here is my ranking:

1. [Corrochios](https://corrochios.com) - Great atmosphere, authentic food
2. [La Chingada](https://lachingada.co.uk) - Our local, super chilled
3. [Tacos El Pastor](https://www.tacoselpastor.co.uk) - Stylish, pricey
4. [Jalisco](https://jaliscokitchenandbar.co.uk) - Unmatched burritos
5. [Mestizo](https://www.mestizo-chelsea.com) - Upmarket, creative menu

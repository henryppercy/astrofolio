Been really motivated to code recently and while I was away in Cologne I came up with a million and 1 project ideas. I wrote them all down and now have a list about 25 items long.

The first few I completed were just small tweaks to my work environment; trying out [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), as well as switching to [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/).

Up next was starting back with learning [Go](https://go.dev/). It was one of those things that I spent couple of weeks building [things](https://github.com/henryppercy/fpl-go-bot) with, but I wasn't coding enough in my spare time to make it stick.

And the latest has been to add an updates feed to this site, and an hour or two of coding later here we are. It is built using Astro [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/):

```ts
const slice = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    location: z.string(),
    created_at: z.string().transform((str: string) => new Date(str)),
    updated_at: z.string().transform((str: string) => new Date(str)).optional(),
    is_published: z.boolean(),
    image: z.object({
      url: z.string(),
      alt: z.string()
    }).optional(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  }),
});
```

No doubt I'll be adding and tweaking this a lot over the coming months, but for now I am happy to have a place to update up this site more regularly.
